1. Need to determine what to rotate

2. Consider cube 9
a. It's position (1, 1, 0)
b. moving it to the left would require a model rotation.

3. Consider the cube in its neutral position

4. Any lateral rotation does not require a model rotation

5. All horizontal rotations require a model rotation

6. There are three states the cube needs to rotate into to display every transformation

7. Each cube face has four directions it can go

8. Check the subsequent cubeface in that direction --
 is it a sibling element? If so, you can rotate for free. (ish)

9.If not, determine one of the two rotations -- how? 

10. Basically, check the "rotation direction" .. of which there are 3 per axis, so 9 things

11. I can rule out one (if I can figure out how) leaving only the target

12. It's always "one" of the things for each thing so I could just memoize them

a. topswizzle --> firstMutation 
b. firstMutation --> tops

13. Put all the faces into three groups. 

14. Now, we know the following

a. The group (two faces)

b. The direction  (up, down , etc);

c. We know the current model rotation

d. We know the east/west are fine, north is a rotation to firstMutation

e. So we just do the logic for each group i dont see a simpler way

NewDay:  rotateModel90X(); When dragged south, achieves the rotation I want towards the user
//rotate model90x turns it "right"
